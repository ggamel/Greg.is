# greg.is (2018 edition)

This is the source for my primary website.

## Rules for the site

- Static files
- Easy to change as needed
- React
- Prefer SVGs
- Pages and Posts have the option for custom layouts/designs
- All images get saved as originals / process to minify as needed
- Experiments are easy to launch and share
- Continuous Integration
- SSL
- Micro & Regular Blog
- Analytics only if they behave (see: https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-google-analytics-setup-i-use-on-every-site-i-build/)
