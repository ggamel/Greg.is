# greg.is v3 (2016)

This is the source for my personal/professional website.

## Rules for the site

- Static files
- Easy to change as needed
- Current with latest Jekyll (+Siteleaf) features
- Retina (prefer SVGs)
- Pages and Posts get custom layouts/designs (*if desired*)
- All images get saved as originals
- Experiments are easy to launch and share
